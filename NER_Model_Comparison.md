# 📊 NER Model Comparison Guide

This document outlines the process for comparing different **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** models on the same dataset using a defined ground truth. The goal is to evaluate and benchmark the performance of various NER approaches like **spaCy**, **BERT-based models**, **Flair**, and **Stanza**.

---

## 🚀 Objective
- Evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of different NER models on the same labeled dataset.
- Identify which model performs best for extracting entities (e.g., organizations, people, locations) in business news articles.
- Compare models based on **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-Score**, and **Entity-Level Accuracy**.

---

## 📂 Dataset Preparation
- **Source:** Custom-annotated business news articles.
- **Format:** TBD for Training
- **Ground Truth:** TBD

---

## 🤖 NER Models to Compare
1. **spaCy NER**
   - `en_core_web_sm` (small, fast)
   - `en_core_web_trf` (Transformer-based, higher accuracy)

2. **BERT-based Models** (Hugging Face Transformers)
   - `bert-base-cased`
   - `roberta-base`

Other Models will be defined soon...

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision:** Correctly predicted entities / Total predicted entities  
- **Recall:** Correctly predicted entities / Total ground truth entities  
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall  
- **Entity-Level Accuracy:** Correct entity predictions over total entities

---

## 🔄 Evaluation Process
1. **Preprocess Dataset**
   - Convert data into a format compatible with all models.

2. **Run NER Models**
   - Apply each NER model to the same dataset.

3. **Align Predictions with Ground Truth**
   - Map model outputs to annotated entities.

4. **Calculate Metrics**
   - Use Scikit-learn's metrics for Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

5. **Visualize Results**
   - Plot bar charts comparing F1-Scores, Precision, and Recall for each model.
